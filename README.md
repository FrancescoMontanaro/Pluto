# Pluto

Pluto is a robot built to engage people to visit the virtual exposition of the space exhibition at the Museu Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci during the Covid pandemic.
The objective was to create one single robot, easy to use, that could be deployed by anyone who read the simple manual and that accomplish two different missions:
- First scenario is during covid, so the idea was to attract people at train stations, or semi-public areas with the objective of getting peoples attention and inviting them to visit the virtual exposition
- The second one was to be placed inside the museum after it opens, being part of the exhibition it self.
